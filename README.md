# Minimal Shopify Theme (converted from bolt.new index.html)

What you need to do before uploading:

1. Build your bolt.new project (Vite/React) locally: `npm run build`.
2. Take the generated JS bundle (e.g., `dist/assets/main.js`) and replace `assets/theme.js` with it.
3. Upload font files to `assets/playfair-400.woff2` and `assets/playfair-700.woff2`.
4. Add any images to `assets/`.
5. Optionally customize `layout/theme.liquid` meta tags and `sections/*`.
6. Zip this folder and push to GitHub or use Shopify CLI (`shopify theme push`).

File list:
- layout/theme.liquid
- templates/index.liquid
- sections/home.liquid
- sections/header.liquid
- sections/footer.liquid
- assets/theme.css
- assets/theme.js (placeholder)
- config/settings_schema.json
